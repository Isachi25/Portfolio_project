            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>Growing up in the city, there was an instance where we spent nearly an hour looking for a parking space to attend a function my friend was hosting. The frustration of that experience made me realize the amount of time one would save if parking were simpler. One evening, Stanley and I were brainstorming on project ideas for our portfolio project, the choice was clear. We both wanted to tackle a real-world problem that we had personally experienced. Working on this project has been challenging and fulfilling at the same time. It has allowed us to blend our technical skills with a personal passion for solving everyday problems.</p>
